# Daily Blog

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Daily Blog App! This repository contains the source code for a powerful blogging platform equipped with essential features like user authentication, post management, and content creation. It utilizes Appwrite as the backend service for managing the database and storage operations.

## Introduction

Daily Blog is a full-fledged blog application built with React.js that offers the following features:

### User Management
- Users can register for new accounts using a signup form with validation (powered by React Hook Form).
- Existing users can log in securely using Appwrite for authentication.
- Users can log out seamlessly, clearing authentication tokens.

### Post Creation
- Authorized users can create new blog posts, crafting content with ease using a rich text editor (like TinyMCE).
- Post data is stored securely in Appwrite's database.

### Post Listing
- A clear and organized list displays all published blog posts.
- Each post showcases the title, author, and a snippet of the content.
- Consider implementing pagination or sorting for extensive post management (optional).

### Update Post
- Users can update their existing posts if they are logged in and own the post.
- Users can also delete their own posts.

### Route Management
- The application leverages `react-router-dom` for efficient routing between different sections.
- Specific routes handle authentication (login, logout), post creation, and post listing.
